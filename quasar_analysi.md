# Quasar Project Security & Code Quality Analysis

_Date: 2025-04-05_

---

## 1. Secrets & Sensitive Data Exposure

- The `.env` file **contains production credentials**:
  - **PostgreSQL URL** with embedded username & password.
  - **JWT secret** used for signing tokens.
- `.env` **is correctly excluded** in `.gitignore`, so **should not be committed**. If it was ever committed before `.gitignore` was set, **rotate all secrets immediately**.
- No plaintext secrets or API keys were found hardcoded in source files.

---

## 2. JWT Secret Handling

- The backend uses:
  ```js
  const JWT_SECRET = process.env.JWT_SECRET || 'your-default-very-strong-secret-key';
  ```
- If the environment variable is missing, it falls back to a **weak, default secret**, which is insecure.
- **Recommendation:** Remove the fallback or ensure production environments always set a strong secret.

---

## 3. Dependency Review

- Backend dependencies (`express`, `helmet`, `bcrypt`, `jsonwebtoken`, etc.) are **up-to-date and appropriate**.
- No deprecated or insecure packages detected.
- Security libraries (`helmet`, `express-rate-limit`, `dompurify`) are used, which is good.

---

## 4. Backend Code Quality & Security

- **Environment variables** are loaded securely with `dotenv`.
- **Password hashing** uses bcrypt with 10 salt rounds.
- **CORS** is restricted to specific frontend URLs.
- **Security headers** are set via `helmet`.
- **Rate limiting** is enabled.
- **Database queries** use parameterized queries via `pg`.
- **Database schema** enforces unique usernames, hashed passwords, and foreign key constraints.
- **JWT warning** is logged if the default secret is used.
- **Potential improvements:**
  - Enforce **password complexity rules** during registration.
  - Consider enabling **SSL verification** (`rejectUnauthorized: true`) if supported by hosting.
  - Rotate secrets regularly.

---

## 5. Frontend Observations

- No secrets or sensitive data found in frontend files.
- `authToken` is stored in `localStorage`, which is common but exposes it to XSS risks.
- Use of `dompurify` helps mitigate XSS.

---

## 6. Summary

The project demonstrates **generally good security practices** with some areas to improve:

- **Never commit `.env` files** with secrets; rotate secrets if this ever happened.
- **Remove insecure JWT secret fallback**.
- **Enforce strong password policies**.
- **Verify SSL certificates** in production if possible.
- **Regularly audit dependencies** for vulnerabilities.

## 7. Frontend UI & UX Improvement Suggestions

### Visual Design & Layout
- Use **CSS Grid** alongside Flexbox for more complex, responsive layouts.
- Add **subtle animations** for card flips, dropdowns, and button presses to enhance interactivity.
- Improve **color contrast** in some palettes for better accessibility compliance.
- Consider **larger tap targets** and spacing for mobile usability.
- Add **loading skeletons** or shimmer effects during data fetches for better perceived performance.
- Use **consistent iconography** and possibly more icon cues for actions.
- Enhance **visual hierarchy** with clearer section separation, typography, and spacing.

### Responsiveness & Accessibility
- Add **ARIA roles, labels, and landmarks** to improve screen reader support.
- Manage **focus states** when modals open/close for better keyboard navigation.
- Respect user preferences for **reduced motion** with `prefers-reduced-motion` media query.
- Improve **form validation feedback** with inline error messages and accessible alerts.
- Use more **semantic HTML5 elements** like `<main>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`, and `<aside>` for structure.

### Interactivity & User Experience
- Add **undo options** for destructive actions like delete.
- Implement **optimistic UI updates** for faster perceived interactions.
- Animate **progress bar** updates smoothly.
- Add **tooltips** or helper texts for buttons and features.
- Provide **success/error feedback** inline near the action, not just in status bars.
- Consider **drag-and-drop** for card reordering or importing files.

### Theming & Customization
- Allow **custom color palette creation** or more palette presets.
- Support **font size adjustments** for accessibility.
- Animate **theme and palette transitions** smoothly.
- Lazy load **fonts and icons** to improve initial load performance.

### Code Structure & Maintainability
- Modularize JavaScript into **ES6 modules** or components.
- Consider adopting a **frontend framework** (React, Vue, Svelte) for scalability.
- Use **CSS variables** extensively (already well done) and consider **CSS custom properties** for dynamic themes.
- Add **unit tests** for UI logic and API interactions.
- Document **public functions** and complex logic inline.
