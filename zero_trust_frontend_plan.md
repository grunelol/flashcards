# Zero Trust Frontend Plan

_This plan outlines how to prevent the frontend client from having any sensitive data or direct access to backend APIs._

---

## 1. Core Principles

- **No JWT tokens, API keys, or secrets stored or accessible on the client.**
- **No direct API calls from the frontend to the backend.**
- **All sensitive operations handled server-side.**
- **Frontend becomes a "dumb" UI layer.**

---

## 2. Authentication via HttpOnly Cookies

- Backend issues **HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite cookies** after login.
- Cookies are **inaccessible to JavaScript**, preventing XSS token theft.
- Backend validates cookies on every request.
- No JWT tokens or secrets are exposed to the client.

---

## 3. Remove Direct API Calls

- Frontend **does not call backend APIs directly**.
- Instead, all requests go through a **backend proxy** or **server-side rendering (SSR)** layer.
- The backend handles:
  - Authentication
  - Authorization
  - Data fetching
  - Business logic
- Frontend only receives **sanitized, non-sensitive data**.

---

## 4. Frontend Changes

- Remove all fetch/XHR calls to backend APIs.
- Replace with calls to **backend-controlled endpoints** that:
  - Render pages
  - Return minimal, non-sensitive data
- Avoid exposing any internal URLs or endpoints.

---

## 5. Backend Changes

- Implement **session management** with HttpOnly cookies.
- Add **API proxy endpoints** that:
  - Authenticate requests via cookies
  - Sanitize and filter data
  - Prevent abuse or unauthorized access
- Enforce **strict CORS policies** to allow only trusted origins.

---

## 6. Error Handling

- Backend returns **generic error messages**.
- No stack traces, validation details, or sensitive info sent to client.
- Log detailed errors **server-side only**.

---

## 7. Deployment & Security

- Enforce **HTTPS** everywhere.
- Use **rate limiting** and **WAF** to prevent abuse.
- Regularly **rotate secrets** and **monitor logs**.

---

## 8. Summary

- **No tokens or secrets on the client.**
- **No direct API calls from client to backend.**
- **All sensitive logic handled server-side.**
- **Frontend is a pure UI layer, with no sensitive capabilities.**

_This architecture greatly reduces the attack surface by fully isolating sensitive data and logic on the server._
